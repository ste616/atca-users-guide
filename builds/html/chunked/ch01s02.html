      The <acronym class="acronym">ATCA</acronym> is an array of six 22m diameter antennas located
      237m above sea level at latitude
      -30° 18&#8242; 46.385&#8243; south, longitude
      149° 33&#8242; 00.500&#8243; east.
      <a class="indexterm" name="idm46395607860224"></a>
      The array has a 3km east-west track with a 214m northern
      spur.  Five antennas can be moved along these tracks, with the sixth
      antenna at a fixed position 3km to the west of the east-west track.  The
      longest possible baseline is, therefore, 6km.
      The array can be used for observations in five wavelength bands
      between 27cm and (with five antennas only) 3mm,
      between frequencies of approximately 1.1GHz and 105GHz.

	The location of six

	The westernmost antenna, CA06, is fixed in position.
	The other five antennas can be positioned at any of 44 fixed stations.
	<a class="indexterm" name="idm46395607851504"></a>
	The station posts provide mains power to the antennas and network connections
	that allow commands from the control building to be sent to the antenna, and monitor data
	to be received from the antenna. The posts also have high-speed
	optical links that allow data from the antenna
	to be transferred to the control building. The smallest baseline
	increment available is 15.306m, and the shortest physical baseline is
	30.612m.

      <p>
	A standard set of 17 configurations has been defined, and a subset of these
	is offered for each semester. These configurations have been designed to give
	optimum, minimum-redundancy coverage after a 12 hour observing period.
	Four configuration sets for the principal arrays (750m, 1.5km and
	6km) are offered over several semesters (see <a class="xref" href="aph.html" title="Appendix H. ATCA Configurations">Appendix H</a>
	for details of these sets).
	Your choice of configuration depends on the
	extent, brightness and complexity of your source (see below).

      <p>
	The Australia Telescope Compact Array is an earth-rotation aperture synthesis
	radio interferometer. Earth-rotation aperture synthesis
	was first used in the 1950s for radio observations of the sun.
	The technique is comprehensively explained, with a historical perspective, in
	<em class="wordasword">Interferometry and Synthesis in Radio Astronomy</em> by
	Thompson, Moran &amp; Swenson (Wiley, 1st edition 1986, 2nd edition 2001).
	Essentially, the array of antennas is comprised of a number of two-element
	interferometers.
	The visibility (i.e., the fraction of the signal common to both
	antennas of a pair) is derived by multiplying the (suitably delayed)
	signals together. By combining the correlated signals obtained over a long
	period of time and with a large range of spacings between antennas, the
	Compact Array measures the spatial coherence function:
      </p>

      <p>
	</p><div class="informalequation">
	  <script type="math/tex; mode=display">
	    \mathrm{V} = \int \mathrm{I}_{\nu}(\mathbf{s}) e^{2\pi i \mathbf{s}\cdot(\mathbf{r_{1}} - \mathbf{r_{2})}} d\Omega
	  </script>
	</div><p>
	where <script type="math/tex">\mathrm{I}_{\nu}(\mathbf{s})</script>
	is the two dimensional intensity
	<a class="indexterm" name="idm46395607841056"></a>
	distribution on the sky,
	<script type="math/tex">\mathbf{s}</script>
	is the unit vector in the direction
	of the celestial source,
	<script type="math/tex">(\mathbf{r_{1}} - \mathbf{r_{2}})</script>
	is the separation vector between antennas 1 and 2 and
	<script type="math/tex">d\Omega</script>
	indicates integration over the sphere (or, in practice, solid angle of the antenna beam).
      </p>

      <p>
	The van Cittert&#8211;Zernike theorem states that the Fourier
	transformation of the spatial coherence function yields the source
	brightness distribution, i.e., the Fourier Transform of the
	visibilities produces an image of a radio source. The image is formed
	with the same angular resolution 
	as for observations with a single antenna with a diameter equal to the
	largest spacing, however it will be less sensitive due to the interferometer's
	smaller collecting area.
      </p>

      <p>
	By plotting the tracks that the baseline vectors trace out (from the source's perspective)
	as the Earth rotates, astronomers can gauge how good the telescope will be at
	imaging the source and resolving components in the field of view.
	This plot is referred to as the
	(u,v)-coverage as, by convention, the two orthogonal axes of the
	plot are u and v.
	<a class="indexterm" name="idm46395607835776"></a>
	These variables have units of the observing wavelength.
	The (u,v)-coverage shows where on the Fourier plane the image has been
	sampled.
      </p>

      <p>
	To obtain the fullest (u,v) coverage with the <acronym class="acronym">ATCA</acronym> would require
	observations with multiple different configurations, and for twelve hours with
	each configuration. However, almost any program can be successfully carried out
	with less than complete (u,v) coverage, and the individual configurations
	are chosen so as to optimise single configuration imaging
	characteristics. Sophisticated off-line image processing techniques
	minimise the effect of missing (u,v) coverage and allow reasonable
	images to be made with one configuration. For most programs, one to
	four configurations provide the best compromise between dynamic range,
	(u,v) coverage and time.
      </p>

      <p>
	The smallest synthesized beamwidths in Right Ascension for each observing
	wavelength are shown in <a class="xref" href="ch01s02.html#table_sensitivity" title="Table 1.1. Observing Parameters for the 6km Compact Array.">Table 1.1</a>, but bear
	in mind that, for east-west arrays, the beamwidth in Declination is greater by
	a factor cosec(Dec). At high angular resolution, the telescope is only
	useful for observing southern objects.  North of Declination
	-24°, full (u,v)-coverage is unobtainable;
	near Declination zero the beam is highly elongated north-south; and
	north of Declination +48° sources are below the
	telescope's +12° elevation limit and are inaccessible.
	For lower angular resolution,
	the north-south and hybrid arrays improve the (u,v)-coverage
	for equatorial sources, but only up to a maximum north-south baseline
	of 214m.

	The antennas have a Cassegrain design, i.e., the receivers are located
	in a turret that protrudes through the main reflector
	surface &#8212; see <a class="xref" href="ch01s02.html#atcatrack" title="Figure 1.1. Five of the six ATCA antennas in the H75 array.">Figure 1.1</a>.  The antennas have an altitude-azimuth
	mount with wrap limits as shown in the figure.  The shaped (i.e.,
	non-parabolic) dish and subreflector surfaces are designed to maximise
	<a class="indexterm" name="idm46395607819280"></a>
	the gain to antenna noise ratio.  The reflecting surface of antennas
	1&#8211;5 are solid panels that allow observations up to 116 GHz. This is
	also true of the inner 15.3m of antenna 6. The outer reflecting
	surface of antenna 6 is made of perforated panels which 
permit observations at frequencies up to 50 GHz.

	<a class="indexterm" name="idm46395607817056"></a>
	The subreflector mounted near the prime focus has a specially designed
	shape, differing slightly from the hyperbolic secondary of standard
	Cassegrain optics.  The feedhorns are mounted on
	the optic axis &#8212; this allows polarisation measurements to
	be made, with very low (
	<script type="math/tex">\sim 1\%</script>)
	instrumental polarisation. Subreflector focus is presently chosen to best suit 3mm
	observations and is adjusted for some antennas for the 7mm and 4cm bands.
	This means that the subreflectors positions may be slightly less than
	ideal for longer wavelengths. If you need better focus settings,
	discuss your requirements with local staff.
	<a class="indexterm" name="idm46395607814800"></a>
	A major feature of the <acronym class="acronym">ATCA</acronym> is its wide bandwidth operation. The
	feedhorns and front-end electronics operate over a very large range of
	frequencies, thus allowing (u,v) coverage to be increased by
	multi-frequency synthesis and dual frequency observations. The
	feedhorns are compact, with a corrugated interior
	<a class="indexterm" name="idm46395607812832"></a>
	surface and are designed for maximum frequency coverage, low noise,
	low spillover, low reflection and low cross-polarisation sidelobe
	levels. The feedhorns allow two simultaneous orthogonal linear
	<a class="indexterm" name="idm46395607811968"></a>
	polarisations to be measured (at frequencies almost an octave apart),
	and have a main lobe with near-constant, symmetrical beamwidth

	<a class="indexterm" name="idm46395607803056"></a>
	<em class="firstterm">band</em>.  Bands are referred to by the wavelength of the approximate centre
	of the band or (especially at higher frequencies) by the frequency (and
	sometimes by the letter-codes shown over the columns of <a class="xref" href="ch01s02.html#table_sensitivity" title="Table 1.1. Observing Parameters for the 6km Compact Array.">Table 1.1</a>.
	There are presently five feedhorns mounted on each antenna (four on
	antenna 6): a large (2m high) feed-horn that operates in the
	16cm band, and a somewhat smaller (50cm high) 4cm band
	feedhorn and three (several cm high) feedhorns mounted on the same dewar
	for the 15mm, 7mm and 3mm wavelengths.
	<a class="indexterm" name="idm46395607800400"></a>
	The feedhorns and the receivers are mounted on a rotating turret. The
	rotating turret design ensures that all feedhorns, when brought on-axis,
	<a class="indexterm" name="idm46395607799424"></a>
	are aligned with the
	optic axis of the antenna, allowing a wide field of view and
	dual-polarisation observations. The turrets are rotated automatically
	in accordance with the frequencies selected by the observing file.
	Rotating the turret orients the desired feed-horn and also ensures
	that the subsequent electronics suit the frequency at which you are
	observing.
	Changing the observing band to or
	from 7mm requires first rotating the turret to the 15mm position, and
	then translating the whole mm dewar to bring the 7mm feed on axis. The
	latter stage takes 2~3 minutes, and so changes to or from 7mm are
	much slower than any other band change.
      </p>
      <p>
	<a class="indexterm" name="idm46395607797600"></a>
	Both the 16cm and 4cm band feedhorns are fitted with wide-bandwidth
	receivers that covers the horn's entire usable frequency range. All receivers run
	continuously and use cooled HEMT (high electron mobility transistor) and FET (field effect transistor)
	amplifiers that provide wide bandwidths and total system temperatures
	between 20K to 65K, depending on frequency.
      </p>
      <p>
	The signals collected by the feedhorns are fed to the receiver systems
	for amplification and conversion to standard intermediate
	frequencies. During observations each antenna provides four
	independent intermediate frequency (IF) outputs (two frequency bands,
	two polarisations). These channels allow simultaneous observations of
	<a class="indexterm" name="idm46395607795584"></a>
	<a class="indexterm" name="idm46395607794480"></a>
	both polarisations at the two available frequencies in either
	dual-receiver system. The frequencies can be anywhere in the range
	covered by the selected feed-horn except at 15, 7 and 3mm where the two
	frequencies must be less than 6 GHz apart, and not straddle the
	7mm sideband inversion (see <a class="xref" href="ch02s03.html#strategy-frequency-switching" title="2.3.6. Are there limits to the frequencies I can observe?">Section 2.3.6</a>).
      </p>
      <p>
	<a class="indexterm" name="idm46395607792400"></a>
	In order to convert the received radio signals to lower frequencies,
	the radio signals are mixed with a &#8220;local oscillator" signal. Four local oscillator signals provide
	four IF outputs to enable the dual-frequency, dual-polarisation
	operation. You can also switch frequencies at the end of each
	<a class="indexterm" name="idm46395607791216"></a>
	integration cycle (typically ten seconds). To change to a pair of
	frequencies covered by a different feed-horn requires a rotation of
	the turret and takes about twenty seconds. However, to avoid excessive
	wear of the turrets, a limit of four rotations per hour is imposed. Thus
	time sharing between a number of frequencies is limited only by signal
	to noise ratio, wear and tear on the equipment, your imagination, and
	the off-line software.

	The following sections describe the path of the signal from the initial
	reflection off the antenna surface, through to the data recorded onto
	export media, in more detail than the introduction above.
	Some radio-astronomy jargon is also explained, as is some important
	mathematics. The details of this section are not required by observers, but are
	included for completeness. A knowledge of the system
	is however essential if you want to design an experiment that uses the
	array in a new or unconventional way. Familiarity with the names and
	functions of some critical components can also be helpful if you need
	to diagnose faults. Many system components are housed in modules, and
	repairs can be made quickly by local staff replacing a module once a correct
	diagnosis has been made.

	Radio waves (approximately within a range of 300 MHz to 120 GHz) are
	accurately reflected from the primary surface of the main parabolic
	dish and are re-reflected off a secondary reflector into a feed-horn.
	At the base of the feed-horn is a directional, coupling waveguide. In
	this coupler (the <em class="firstterm">noise coupler</em>) is a
	<a class="indexterm" name="idm46395607778768"></a>
	diode that injects a noise signal of known amplitude. This noise
	signal is used to calibrate the system temperature (<a class="xref" href="ch01s02.html#system_temperature" title="Equation 1.1. System Temperature">Equation 1.1</a>)
	and gain of the receiving system.

	For radiation emitted by a randomly polarised source, the
	power received by a radio telescope is given by:

	    \mathrm{P}_{\mathrm{received}} = \frac{1}{2}\mathrm{A}\mathrm{S} \Delta\nu,

	where A is the effective area of the antenna, S is the spectral power flux
	density and
	<script type="math/tex">\Delta\nu</script>
	is the range of frequencies observed
	(the effective bandwidth). The factor of
	<a class="indexterm" name="idm46395607774160"></a>
	<script type="math/tex">\frac{1}{2}</script>

	<acronym class="acronym">ATCA</acronym> overcomes this limitation by providing separate detectors and electronics for two

	The <em class="firstterm">sensitivity</em> of a radio telescope is the minimum signal power that
	can be distinguished from the random fluctuations at the output of the
	receiving system which are caused by noise inherent in the system. The
	sensitivity is usually defined as the spectral power flux density
	of a source that would produce the same
	signal power as the noise power. It is
	measured in <em class="firstterm">Jansky</em> (<abbr class="abbrev">Jy</abbr>), with 
	<script type="math/tex">1 \mathrm{Jy} = 10^{-26} \mathrm{\,W\,m}^{-2} \mathrm{\,Hz}^{-1}.

	The <em class="firstterm">noise power</em> consists of two main components: the noise power due
	to the receiving amplifier and other electrical system components, and
	the noise due to ground radiation, thermal emission from the
	atmosphere (which varies with elevation, cloud cover, etc.), background
	radio emission from our Galaxy and other sources detected by the
	antenna. These noise powers are usually referred to as <em class="firstterm">equivalent
	temperatures</em>, although at no

	point is a physical temperature measured. The &#8220;temperature&#8221; due to
	the noise power is called the <em class="firstterm">system temperature</em>,
	<script type="math/tex">\mathrm{T}_{\mathrm{sys}}</script>,
	and is related to the noise power by:

	where 
	<script type="math/tex">\mathrm{P}_{\mathrm{noise}}</script>
	is the noise power and

	in nature, measurements of the power levels made at time intervals
	separated by 
	<script type="math/tex">(2 \Delta\nu)^{-1}</script>
	can be considered independent
	(e.g., Thompson, Moran &amp; Swenson 1986, 2001).  If the signal level is

	The signal to noise ratio is the ratio of the power in the output that

	equivalent temperature of the radio source being observed. Note that

	contribution to the noise power from radio noise detected by the
	antenna, as described above. For typical values for bandwidth (2 GHz)

	The noise source in the noise coupler injects a signal that is about 5%

	signal is synchronously demodulated and the following relationship

	300K
	<script type="math/tex">+ \mathrm{T}_{\mathrm{sys}}</script>)
	directly above the feeds. The power received

	the antenna just looking at the sky (
	<script type="math/tex">\sim \mathrm{T}_{\mathrm{sys}} + 3\mathrm{\,K}</script>).
	This measurement is used to establish the level of

	which is assumed not to vary with time. The measurement of system and antenna
	temperature is described in a 
	<a class="ulink" href="http://www.atnf.csiro.au/observers/memos/d95b94%7E1.pdf" target="_top">technical memo by

      <p>
	The noise coupler is mounted on another coupler
	<a class="indexterm" name="idm46395607645152"></a>
	<a class="indexterm" name="idm46395607644256"></a>
	that provides a vacuum seal between the noise coupler and the subsequent
	receiver system, which is housed in an evacuated, cryogenic
	cylinder. An air gap
	<a class="indexterm" name="idm46395607642912"></a>
	<a class="indexterm" name="idm46395607642128"></a>
	thermally isolates the cylinder, the contents of which are cooled by a
	helium pump to 20K. The second coupler is mounted on the polariser.
	<a class="indexterm" name="idm46395607640768"></a>
	<a class="indexterm" name="idm46395607639664"></a>
	The dual function of the polariser is to select the two linear
	polarisations and the desired band, so it is also known as a
	<em class="firstterm">band splitter</em>. The
	<a class="indexterm" name="idm46395607638272"></a>
	polariser consists of four strips of metal inside a conical waveguide
	<a class="indexterm" name="idm46395607637024"></a>
	that &#8220;guide&#8221; two orthogonal linear polarisations into probes at the
	narrow end of the polariser. The way in which the metal strips select
	the linear polarisations can be thought of as analogous to the effect
	of a ridged waveguide, which constrains a particular mode to propagate
	along the region between the ridge and the roof of the waveguide. The
	probes are simply short (with respect to the wavelength) lengths of
	the cores of the coaxial cables that take the signal into the first
	amplifiers. Thus the polariser converts a wave into a voltage: the
	impedance of the circuit is effectively the same as a waveguide
	impedance, so it works like a well-matched load. The polariser's
	official title is quad-ridged
	<em class="firstterm">orthomode transducer</em>, or <acronym class="acronym">OMT</acronym>.
	<a class="indexterm" name="idm46395607634368"></a>
	<a class="indexterm" name="idm46395607633184"></a>
	Separate electronics exist for both orthogonal linear polarisations,
	which are measured simultaneously. The position angle of the polariser
	is fixed with respect to the antenna. As the antennas have
	altitude-azimuth mounts, the position angle of the linear probes
	rotate on the sky during the course of an observation (imagine a
	circumpolar line on the sky orbiting around a stationary antenna).
	Measurement of both polarisations is therefore required for polarised
	sources. The two linear polarisations can be combined to give an
	accurate total
	<a class="indexterm" name="idm46395607632368"></a>
	<a class="indexterm" name="idm46395607630944"></a>
	intensity: the Stokes I parameter. Without
	<a class="indexterm" name="idm46395607629760"></a>
	additional calibration, the other Stokes parameters
	(the linear polarisation measures Q, and U, and the
	circularly polarised component V) can
	be in error by about 2% of the value of I. Measurements of the
	phase difference of the two linear polarisations (referred to as the X and
	<a class="indexterm" name="idm46395607628976"></a>
	<a class="indexterm" name="idm46395607627504"></a>
	Y (or A and B) polarisations) at the receiver by on-line hardware may
	need further off-line calibration.
      </p>
      
      <p>
	For an unpolarised source, observing both orthogonal polarisations
	offers a
	<script type="math/tex">\sqrt{2}</script>
	improvement in signal to noise ratio for an I
	image over an image generated from only one polarisation.

	The signal is taken from the feedhorn into
	
	<a class="indexterm" name="idm46395607621920"></a>
	a low noise, broadband amplifier.
      </p>
      
      <p>
	The receivers each use two low-noise
	<a class="indexterm" name="idm46395607619856"></a>
	amplifiers (<acronym class="acronym">LNA</acronym>s) to amplify the signal by 30&#8211;40 dB.

	<a class="indexterm" name="idm46395607613824"></a>
	are used at 15mm, 7mm and 3mm.  Only the &#8220;inner"
	five antennas (i.e., excluding CA06) have 3mm receivers.
	The accessible
	frequency range is given in <a class="xref" href="ch01s02.html#table_sensitivity" title="Table 1.1. Observing Parameters for the 6km Compact Array.">Table 1.1</a>, and

	frequencies outside these nominal limits may be accessible.
      </p>

      <p>
	The next step is the conversion to the frequency range that is used by
	the <acronym class="acronym">CABB</acronym> digitisers. The 4cm
	<a class="indexterm" name="idm46395607609872"></a>
	<a class="indexterm" name="idm46395607609744"></a>
	signals require no conversion, whereas the mm signals require
	a down-conversion stage, and the 16cm signals require
	up-conversion to the 4 to 12 GHz band.
      </p>
      
      <p>
	<a class="indexterm" name="idm46395607606720"></a>
	The local oscillator signals have a relatively narrow tuning range,
	lying in the regions between the radio frequency bands (this reduces
	the likelihood of self-generated interference).  The conversion system
	is flexible, allowing the input signals to be within the same band
	(e.g., both in the 4cm centred band), or one from each of the two
	bands simultaneously received by the wide-band feed-horn.

      <p>
	The final output from the conversion system is sent to the <em class="firstterm">samplers</em>
	for digitisation. The <acronym class="acronym">CABB</acronym> (Compact Array Broadband Backend) samplers were developed in-house and are capable
	of 4 gigasamples per second (GS/s), with 10 bit sampling (more information is
	available in the
	<a class="ulink" href="http://www.atnf.csiro.au/news/newsletter/feb07/CABB_upgrade.htm" target="_top">
	  February 2007 <acronym class="acronym">ATNF</acronym> newsletter</a>

      </p>
      
      <p>
	The samplers, which are also referred to as the
	<acronym class="acronym">CABB</acronym> digitisers, do two things. First
	<a class="indexterm" name="idm46395607597808"></a>
	the analog (continuously variable in time and amplitude) signal is
	sampled into a discrete-time sequence of values. This process does not
	degrade the signal as it is sampled at the <em class="firstterm">Nyquist rate</em>
	<a class="indexterm" name="idm46395607596208"></a>
	(twice the inverse frequency of the bandwidth of the analog signal).
	Subsequently, each of the discrete-time, continuously variable values
	are converted to one of a finite set of values: this is called
	<em class="firstterm">quantising</em>.
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	<acronym class="acronym">CABB</acronym> uses 9-bit sampling (internally, as stated above, 10-bit sampling is used, with 9 bits transferred to the correlator), with approximately 6-bits
	used in sampling the regular data range, and the additional bits providing
	extra robustness in the case of interference
	<acronym class="acronym">RFI</acronym> (radio-frequency interference).
	The digitised signals from the sampler are sent from each antenna to
	the correlator along optic fibres at a rate of 160 gigabits per
	second for each antenna. Optical fibres run from the samplers in each
	<a class="indexterm" name="idm46395607588688"></a>
	antenna to the correlator, which is housed in the
	screened room (to prevent RFI generated by the correlator electronics from
	affecting the observations) of the central control
	building. Synchronising code is added to the data stream at the start
	of each integration cycle to allow each bit to be correctly identified
	at the correlator irrespective of temporal changes in the length of
	the fibre.
      </p>

      <p>
	<a class="indexterm" name="idm46395607588560"></a>
	<a class="indexterm" name="idm46395607586032"></a>
	The <em class="firstterm">correlator</em> effectively multiplies simultaneous signals from
	two samplers: the more similar the signal from both antennas,
	the large the degree of correlation.  A plane wavefront approaching the
	<acronym class="acronym">ATCA</acronym> will, in general, arrive at different antennas at different
	times. The signals from the antennas therefore need to be <em class="firstterm">delayed</em>
	before being presented to the correlator so as to simulate a wavefront
	arriving at each antenna simultaneously.  This was previously
	achieved by separate

	The <em class="firstterm">delay calibration</em> undertaken at the start of an observation
	removes other delays caused by return path length
	differences, instrumental delay variations and the like, so that
	wavefront samples are presented to the correlator synchronously.

	The <acronym class="acronym">CABB</acronym> filterbank/correlator is divided across a number of Digital Signal Processing (DSP)
	boards. The DSP boards use Virtex-4
	Xilinx Field Programmable Gated Arrays (FPGAs) to provide a flexible, programmable
	hardware correlator.

	The output from the correlator is averaged for the period of one
	<em class="firstterm">integration cycle</em>, and sent to the correlator control computer caccc

	where it is written to hard disk.
	Integration cycles can be set by the observer, between 2 and 30 seconds,
	although the default cycle time of 10 seconds is generally recommended for
	all observers. (For mosaic-mode observations, 6-seconds is the practical
minimum cycle time.)

	The <acronym class="acronym">CABB</acronym> correlator provides a number of observing
	modes:
	</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul class="itemizedlist" style="list-style-type: disc; "><li class="listitem">
            <p>Two always-available 2048 MHz continuum IF bands (although an analogue bandpass filter
	    may reduce the usable bandwidth by 32 MHz). These can currently be divided into 2048 x 1MHz channels or 32 x 64MHz channels, 
	    with up to 16 &#8220;zoom&#8221; bands able to be placed for higher spectral resolution.</p>
          </li><li class="listitem">
            <p>Up to 6 GHz separation of simultaneous IF centre frequencies (depending on receiver restrictions)</p>

          </li><li class="listitem">
            <p>Square, independent channels (ie. no leakage between channels)</p>
          </li><li class="listitem">
            <p>All polarisation parameters for all products (including auto-correlations)</p>
          </li><li class="listitem">

          </li><li class="listitem">
            <p>A pulsar binning mode</p>
          </li></ul></div><p>
        This design ensures that the user will always get high continuum sensitivity from the
	wide-bandwidth IFs, while providing very high spectral resolution for line studies at
	the same time.
