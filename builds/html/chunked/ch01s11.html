      After the Time Assignment Committee (<acronym class="acronym">TAC</acronym>) has met, you will be notified when
      the <acronym class="acronym">TAC</acronym> grades and feedback on your proposal are available. These are available
      to all members of the proposal team through <acronym class="acronym">OPAL</acronym>.
      All proposers are notified when the schedule for the next semester is released, and these schedules
      will appear 
      <a class="ulink" href="http://www.narrabri.atnf.csiro.au/observing/schedules/" target="_top">on the web</a>.
    </p>

    <p>
      Generally, at least one member of the observing team must be present
      at the <acronym class="acronym">SOC</acronym> to do the observations. The visiting observer should be
      well-versed with the needs of their observing program before arriving,
      particularly if they did not write the observing proposal or schedule
      files. If they need assistance from the friend or <acronym class="acronym">DA</acronym> to prepare
      their schedules, they should arrive well before the start of their observations; at
      least two weekdays.
    </p>

    <p>
      Occupational Health and Safety regulations require that
      observers are not to observe for more than 16 hours, so
      <span class="bold"><strong>for long observations you will need more than one observer</strong></span>.
    </p>

    <p>
      Plan your trip to the <acronym class="acronym">SOC</acronym> with the help of the <acronym class="acronym">ATNF</acronym>
      <a class="ulink" href="http://www.atnf.csiro.au/observers/visit" target="_top">Visitor's Information</a>.
      You will need to book transport,
      accommodation and computer resources in Marsfield before arrival.
    </p>

    <p>
      Note that multi-configuration observations are likely to occur weeks
      or even months apart, so you may need to plan either one long visit
      or several short trips.
      Overseas observers will require a valid visa and
      passport for entry into Australia.

      The Compact Array is controlled from user generated schedule files.
      Schedule files are prepared with
      the <a class="ulink" href="http://www.narrabri.atnf.csiro.au/observing/sched" target="_top"><acronym class="acronym">CABB</acronym> web scheduler</a>.
    </p>

    <p>
      Schedules contain source names, positions, frequencies,
      bandwidths, and any other information that
      <span class="command"><strong>caobs</strong></span> needs for observations.

      <a class="indexterm" name="idm46395606993376"></a>
      A useful tool to determine the altitude, azimuth,
      and rising and setting times of astronomical objects, which may help
      with preparation of your schedule files, is coord.
      Currently, this is most easily accessed via the
      <a class="ulink" href="http://www.parkes.atnf.csiro.au/cgi-bin/utilities/coord.cgi" target="_top">Parkes website</a>.
      When using this tool be sure to change the site to
      Australia Telescope Compact Array, and change the elevation limit to
      12 degrees for cm observing at the <acronym class="acronym">ATCA</acronym>.

	A Duty Astronomer will be present at the <acronym class="acronym">SOC</acronym> to help local observers get

      <p>
	The <acronym class="acronym">ATCA</acronym> is responsive to requests for observations of targets of
	opportunity. There are two paths to such observations: through a <acronym class="acronym">NAPA</acronym>
	(non-apriori assignable) project, or through a <acronym class="acronym">ToO</acronym> request.
      </p>
      <p>
	A <acronym class="acronym">NAPA</acronym> project is one whose science goals have been set down in a
	proposal that the <acronym class="acronym">TAC</acronym> has evaluated in the normal way. Such projects
	can be triggered any time during the semester, whenever the investigator wants to
	proceed. The project will have requested a specific amount of time for the semester,
	but this is not binding.
      </p>
      <p>
	A <acronym class="acronym">ToO</acronym> request can also be made at any time during the semester.
	Unlike <acronym class="acronym">NAPA</acronym> projects though, a <acronym class="acronym">ToO</acronym> will not generally
	be allowed to over-ride a scheduled observation.
      </p>
      <div class="section"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h4 class="title"><a name="idm46395606976480"></a>1.11.2.1. Requesting an observation</h4></div></div></div>
	
	<p>
	  The first step to either trigger a <acronym class="acronym">NAPA</acronym> project, or request a
	  <acronym class="acronym">ToO</acronym> observation, is to email either the alerts exploder
	  (<code class="email">&lt;<a class="email" href="mailto:alert@atnf.csiro.au">alert@atnf.csiro.au</a>&gt;</code>) or the scheduler directly
	  (<code class="email">&lt;<a class="email" href="mailto:Jamie.Stevens@csiro.au">Jamie.Stevens@csiro.au</a>&gt;</code>); the former is preferable since there is a greater
	  chance of someone seeing the request quickly.
	</p>
	<p>
	  For a <acronym class="acronym">NAPA</acronym> trigger, you should include in your email the
	  <acronym class="acronym">NAPA</acronym>'s project code, and some details about the source(s) you
	  are triggering on, including at least right ascensions and declinations. For a
	  <acronym class="acronym">ToO</acronym> request, you should also include a short scientific justification
	  for why you want to observe.
	</p>
	<p>
	  If you are requesting a slot of Director's time (also known as green time), then you should
	  also put in a request via the Portal's booking system. If you require an over-ride of
	  scheduled time (only available for <acronym class="acronym">NAPA</acronym> projects), then please state your
	  preferred observation time in your email.
	</p>
	<p>
	  Since the beginning of the 2017OCT semester, it has been possible for almost any <acronym class="acronym">NAPA</acronym>
	  project to over-ride almost any scheduled project. Any exceptions to this will be made clear
	  in the release notes for the semester, and will be communicated privately to the investigators of
	  <acronym class="acronym">NAPA</acronym> projects who cannot avail themselves of over-rides.
	</p>
	<p>
	  The observatory will try to make contact with <acronym class="acronym">NAPA</acronym> requesters as quickly
	  as possible after a trigger has been issued, but sometimes it might not be possible to
	  reach observatory staff (eg. overnight, at weekends, etc.). If the investigators think it necessary,
	  <acronym class="acronym">NAPA</acronym> projects may over-ride scheduled observations without further consultation with
	  observatory staff. We recommend that in such a case, the investigator wishing to over-ride
	  communicate with the current observer in charge to effect the change to the <acronym class="acronym">NAPA</acronym>.
	  It should be noted though that if the <acronym class="acronym">NAPA</acronym> project has already used up the
	  time that it requested for the semester, it is no longer entitled to over-ride scheduled time and
	  must use Director's time instead.
	</p>
	<p>
	  For <acronym class="acronym">NAPA</acronym> projects which require very prompt response to a trigger, we recommend
	  the use of the <a class="xref" href="ch02s05.html" title="2.5. Rapid Response Mode">Section 2.5</a>. Use of this mode is limited in the same
	  way as for a normal <acronym class="acronym">NAPA</acronym>, but an email request does not need to be sent prior to the
	  trigger, and the observing system will manage the transition to the <acronym class="acronym">NAPA</acronym> observations
	  automatically. The investigators of each project that is over-ridden by a rapid response trigger will
	  be notified by email of the displacement, at the time of the trigger.
	</p>
	<p>
	  Otherwise, observatory staff will try to find a time that satisfies the request for <acronym class="acronym">NAPA</acronym>
	  or <acronym class="acronym">ToO</acronym> time that maximises the science output, and minimises the disruption
	  to scheduled time. In any event, all affected investigators will be notified by email as soon as possible
	  after the decision is made.
	</p>
	<p>
	  If multiple requests are received to look at the same target, then staff will need to decide how
	  to allocate the time. In general, <acronym class="acronym">NAPA</acronym> projects will be prioritised over
	  <acronym class="acronym">ToO</acronym> requests, simply because the <acronym class="acronym">TAC</acronym> has already evaluated the
	  science cases for the <acronym class="acronym">NAPA</acronym>s. This will hold even if the <acronym class="acronym">NAPA</acronym>
	  project has exhausted its time allocation for the semester. If multiple <acronym class="acronym">NAPA</acronym>
	  requests are made for the same target, then both the <acronym class="acronym">TAC</acronym> ranking score and the
	  order in which the requests were received will be considered.
	</p>
	<p>
	  It is possible for one <acronym class="acronym">NAPA</acronym> to be over-ridden by another <acronym class="acronym">NAPA</acronym>,
	  if the observatory staff think it appropriate to do so. In such a case, it would be inappropriate for
	  a <acronym class="acronym">NAPA</acronym> investigator to take control of the telescope without first consulting with
	  observatory staff.
	</p>
	<p>
	  Rapid response observations are a special case: the automatic system does not need staff
	  interaction to work, and so if a rapid response request arrives while another <acronym class="acronym">NAPA</acronym>
	  project is being observed, the rapid response over-ride will take priority. Once a rapid response
	  over-ride is being observed, it must be allowed to run for its allocated duration, and the automatic
	  system will reissue the over-ride should the observation be interrupted. Observatory staff do though have
	  the power to stop a rapid response over-ride observation.
