		The name of the source. If the name of a calibrator in the 
		<acronym class="acronym">ATCA</acronym> calibrator database is entered
		into this field, the scheduler will automatically fill the <code class="literal">RA</code>,
		<code class="literal">Dec</code>, <code class="literal">Epoch</code> and <code class="literal">CalCode</code> fields. The information
		in this field will be used by the correlator as the name of the source
		in the output <acronym class="acronym">FITS</acronym> files. If observing a mosaic, this field should be
		set to the name of the mosaic file describing the mosaic pointings,
		without the <code class="literal">.mos</code> extension.

		These fields define where on the sky you want the array to point,
		ie. the phase centre. You must specify <code class="literal">RA</code> in hours, minutes and
		seconds separated by colons (<code class="literal">:</code>), and you must specify 
		<code class="literal">Dec</code> in degrees,
		minutes and seconds separated by colons (<code class="literal">:</code>). The 
		<code class="literal">RA</code> and <code class="literal">Dec</code> will be
		in the system defined by the <code class="literal">Epoch</code> field, thus they can also
		be used to represent azimuth and elevation angles, and Galactic latitude and

		A flag used to specify if a certain source is meant as a calibrator. It
		should either be &#8220;<code class="literal">C</code>&#8221; for a calibrator, or blank for a non-calibrator.
		For baseline solutions, the <code class="literal">CalCode</code> is set to &#8220;<code class="literal">B</code>&#8221;,
		a feature that should not be used by normal observers. When a calibrator is selected
		from the &#8220;<code class="literal">Search Cal</code>&#8221; screens, or matched from input to the
		<code class="literal">Source</code> field, this code will automatically be set to &#8220;<code class="literal">C</code>&#8221;.
		The <code class="literal">CalCode</code> field is reset to blank after a new scan is added
		to avoid inadvertantly calling a target source scan a calibrator scan.
	      </p>
	      
	      <p>
		The <span class="command"><strong>assistance</strong></span> program makes use of the <code class="literal">CalCode</code> field to
		determine the level of on-line checking that is done.  If a calibrator
		scan is indicated, the checks (for stable amplitude, small delays,
		closure phase, etc.) are more stringent.  If a calibrator scan is not
		labelled with &#8220;<code class="literal">CalCode=C</code>&#8221; then these checks will not be performed.
		On the other hand, most target sources have structure and
		insufficient flux, so
		<span class="command"><strong>assistance</strong></span> would sound alarms continuously if a source like that
		was marked as a calibrator scan.
	      </p>
	    </dd><dt><span class="term"><code class="literal">ScanLength</code></span></dt><dd>
	      <p>
		This indicates the length of time to spend on the
		current scan.  It is specified in time format and should be specified
		as <code class="literal">HH:MM:SS</code>, where 
		<code class="literal">HH</code>,<code class="literal">MM</code> and <code class="literal">SS</code> are the number of
		hours, minutes and seconds
		to spend on the source respectively.
		Unless the <code class="literal">ScanType</code> is set to <code class="literal">Dwell</code>, the scan time includes the
		time to drive to the source. The scan must be at least four integration cycles long.
	      </p>
	      
	      <p>
		For many types of scan, this field is essentially meaningless, although it must
		<span class="bold"><strong>always be set to four integration cycles or longer</strong></span>.
		For <code class="literal">Point</code>, <code class="literal">Paddle</code> and <code class="literal">Closefile</code>
		scans, the scan will take as long as it needs to, and the setting of the
		<code class="literal">ScanLength</code> field is unimportant.

		  <p>
		    <code class="literal">Normal</code>: the scan will go for the length of time specified

		    For example, if <code class="literal">ScanLength</code> is set to 10 minutes, then the scan
		    will go for 10 minutes, even it takes 2 minutes to slew to source; in this case, only
		    8 minutes of data will be collected on-source.

		    and the telescope takes 2 minutes to slew to source, then this scan will go for
		    12 minutes, and 10 minutes of data will be collected on-source.

		    If no suitable pointing solution is found, it reverts to the global pointing
		    model, which may cause serious problems, especially at 3mm wavelengths.
		    This mode should be preferred over <code class="literal">Offset</code> pointing if many

		    combined with a <code class="literal">ScanType</code> of <code class="literal">Point</code>, and this should only
		    be done while observing a calibrator.
		  </p>
		  
		  <p>
		    Setting <code class="literal">Pointing</code> to <code class="literal">Refpnt</code> will make the

	      <p>
		If you choose to have a <code class="literal">ScanType</code> of <code class="literal">Point</code> and a

		you should always have <code class="literal">Pointing</code>=<code class="literal">Update</code> for
		<code class="literal">ScanType</code>=<code class="literal">Point</code> so that the pointing offsets determined during
		the pointing scan will be used for all subsequent <code class="literal">Offset</code> and
		<code class="literal">Offpnt</code> scans. There may be other cases where the observer does not
		want the pointing to be automatically updated (such as during an array
		reconfiguration), which is why this option is not strictly forbidden.

	      <p>
		This is an ASCII string up to 12 characters long that is used to
		identify who made the observations. It is not critical to any
		on-line system and is merely a label for reference.
	      </p>
	    </dd><dt><span class="term"><code class="literal">Project</code></span></dt><dd>
	      <p>
		This is the project identification number (<code class="literal">nnn</code>) allocated to
		observing projects, and should be specified here as <code class="literal">Cnnn</code>. The
		<code class="literal">Project</code> field value is used by <span class="command"><strong>cacor</strong></span> to name the extension
		of the output <acronym class="acronym">RPFITS</acronym> files. It is important that it is set correctly
		as it is used for record keeping and by the <acronym class="acronym">ATNF</acronym> Online Archive.
		The default <code class="literal">C999</code> code is used for system testing and test files;
		such files will not be considered as valuable when it comes to deleting
		data.
	      </p>
	      
	      <p>
		The scheduler will complain if you enter a schedule file that doesn't look like
		<code class="literal">Cnnn</code>, <code class="literal">CXnnn</code> or <code class="literal">Vnnna</code> (the latter
		being a <acronym class="acronym">VLBI</acronym> project code). You can choose to ignore the warning, and
		the scheduler will save the schedule, but it is strongly advised that you do not use
		a project code that does not fit the above pattern.
	      </p>
	    </dd><dt><span class="term"><code class="literal">Time</code></span></dt><dd>
	      <p>
		The value of this field can only be set for source 1 in the schedule,
		and is used as the start time of the schedule. If <code class="literal">TimeCode</code> is set
		to <code class="literal">LST</code>, then this value is only used for calculation of slew times
		and elevations by the scheduler's listing tab, and will be ignored by
		<span class="command"><strong>caobs</strong></span>. If <code class="literal">TimeCode</code> is set to <code class="literal">UTC</code> however,
		<span class="command"><strong>caobs</strong></span> will treat the schedule as an absolute time schedule, so each scan will
		only be executed between the time specified here (on the date specified
		in the <code class="literal">Date</code> field) and the time plus the value in <code class="literal">ScanLength</code>.
		This will usually only be useful when coordinating the activities of the
		<acronym class="acronym">ATCA</acronym> with other telescopes (such as for <acronym class="acronym">VLBI</acronym>).
	      </p>
	    </dd><dt><span class="term"><code class="literal">TimeCode</code></span></dt><dd>
	      <p>
		The selection made here sets the type of time desired for the
		<code class="literal">Time</code> field above. It can be either local sidereal time (LST) or
		coordinated universal time (UTC). This field can only set for source
		1 in the schedule. See the description of the <code class="literal">Time</code> field for
		the consequences of setting this field to UTC.
	      </p>
	    </dd><dt><span class="term"><code class="literal">Date</code></span></dt><dd>
	      <p>
		The observing date can be set here to allow the scheduler to correctly
		determine the source positions and drive times. Of course, the date does
		not matter when setting LST, but is of vital importance when the <code class="literal">TimeCode</code>
		is set to UTC.
	      </p>
	      
	      <p>
		This field is also used when the scheduler calculates the apparent frequency of a

		sampler settings assocated with each different field value, and recall
		those settings whenever a scan is encountered with the same value.
		Each frequency setting (modulo 1 MHz) allows for up to 128 such values.
		Valid <code class="literal">Environment</code> values are from 0 to 127.

		Use these fields and the <code class="literal">Offpnt</code> <code class="literal">Pointing</code> type to
		make the telescope point away from the specified RA &amp; Dec.
		<code class="literal">PointingOffset1</code> is the offset in seconds to move in RA,
		and <code class="literal">PointingOffset2</code> is the offset in arcseconds to move in
		Dec. Remember that the phase centre of the observation will always be at
		the position given in the <code class="literal">RA</code> and <code class="literal">Dec</code> fields. Therefore if
		you wish to use these offset pointing fields to avoid a potential DC
		offset issue, you must put an offset position in <code class="literal">RA</code>, <code class="literal">Dec</code> and
		then use <code class="literal">PointingOffset1</code> and <code class="literal">PointingOffset2</code> to shift
		the pointing centre to be on source again.

	      <p>
		When switching between different observing frequencies, the usable range
		of correlator channels will also change, due to RFI or bandpass shape.
		The correlator uses only a certain subset of channels &#8211; called the TV
		channels &#8211; to determine system temperatures, and if the TV channels are
		not kept constant for each individual frequency config then you may
		encounter amplitude problems later in the reduction process. The TV
		channels setting also affects what is displayed by <span class="command"><strong>vis</strong></span>. This parameter
		allows you to set the TV channels on a per scan basis, which makes
		frequency switching a far more automated process. This parameter should
		be either <code class="literal">null</code> to allow the current TV channel setting to be
		left as-is, or a set of four numbers, separated by commas, indicating (in
		order) the first and last TV channel for IF 1, and the first and last TV
		channel for IF 2.
	      </p>

	      <p>
		During normal frequency-switching observations, <span class="command"><strong>cacor</strong></span> will itself
		remember the TV channels on a per-frequency basis, and restore them as the frequencies
		change. If everything works as expected, this scheduler field is not required. This
		field is here in case you don't want to rely upon <span class="command"><strong>cacor</strong></span>'s memory.
	      </p>
	    </dd><dt><span class="term"><code class="literal">Cmd</code></span></dt><dd>
	      <p>
		This field can be used to instruct <span class="command"><strong>caobs</strong></span> to issue one or more commands each time it
		starts this scan. Multiple commands may be specified, separated by
		semi-colons, although this field has an 80 character limit. Each command must
		be a recognised <span class="command"><strong>caobs</strong></span> command. For example,
		the tied-array configuration could be changed by specifying
		<code class="literal">corr catie ant 123456 123456; corr catie gain 0.2 0.2</code>
	      </p>

	      <p>
		The first command listed in this field will be executed as soon as the
		scan is started, and each subsequent command will be executed as soon
		as the previous has been processed. To allow more flexibility in the timing
		of the commands listed in this field, there is a special command <code class="literal">WAIT n</code>.
		This command (which cannot be used in manual <span class="command"><strong>caobs</strong></span> operation), waits for
		<code class="literal">n</code> integrations after the start of the scan. After this condition has been
		met, the commands after the <code class="literal">WAIT</code> command are executed. For example, to
		calibrate the phases after 5 cycles (to allow for data collection), specify
		<code class="literal">wait 5; corr pcal</code>
	      </p>

	      <p>
		There are important caveats on the <code class="literal">WAIT</code> command. It does not guarantee
		on-source cycles will be waited: if the command <code class="literal">wait 5</code> is specified, but
		it takes 5 or more cycles before the telescope gets on-source, the subsequent
		command will likely be executed before valid data is collected. To guard against
		this, consider putting a dummy scan before the scan with the command specification.
		The dummy scan should have a small (one or two cycles) amount of dwell time so
		that <span class="command"><strong>caobs</strong></span> will wait until the telescope is on-source before proceeding to
		the next scheduled scan.
	      </p>

	      <p>
		The <code class="literal">WAIT</code> command is not a progression command either. Take for example
		the following command:
		<code class="literal">wait 5; corr dcal; wait 4; corr pcal</code>
		This command will fail to do what you might naively expect, because after the
		<code class="literal">dcal</code> command is issued, it
		will immediately issue the <code class="literal">pcal</code> command. This is because the <code class="literal">wait 4</code>
		command will immediately exit, as <span class="command"><strong>caobs</strong></span> has already waited for the fifth cycle
		to start, so it will no longer wait for the fourth cycle. Instead, this command
		should be:
		<code class="literal">wait 5; corr dcal; wait 9; corr pcal</code>

		The <code class="literal">CatVel</code> field can be set
		manually, or via the scheduler's "Pick Source" function. This allows for rapid
		and reliable frequency calculation with the scheduler's velocity calculator, as
		the information in this field is automatically propagated into the calculator.
		This field should be set as three values, separated by spaces as follows:
	      </p>
	      <pre class="screen">
velocity velframe velconv
</pre>
	      <p>
		Here, <code class="literal">velocity</code> is the velocity of the source in km/s (recession is positive),
		<code class="literal">velframe</code> is the frame in which the velocity is measured (one of
		<code class="literal">LSR</code> or <code class="literal">Bary</code>), and <code class="literal">velconv</code> is the velocity convention (one of
		<code class="literal">Radio</code>, <code class="literal">Optical</code> or <code class="literal">Z</code>).
	      </p>

	      <p>
		This field must be set if you want to use the scheduler's zoom range checker.
	      </p>
	    </dd><dt><span class="term"><code class="literal">FreqConfig</code></span></dt><dd>
	      <p>
		The <code class="literal">FreqConfig</code> field is used to create a number of frequency and zoom settings that
		can be shared between scans. Setting the continuum frequencies and specifying up to 16
		zooms in each <span class="command"><strong>IF</strong></span> can be tedious and error prone if it has to be repeated for many scans. The
		<code class="literal">FreqConfig</code> field lets you select one or more scans as <code class="literal">Master</code> scans and then
		assign other scans to be <code class="literal">Slave</code> scans. Each <code class="literal">Slave</code> scan inherits the
		exact frequency and zoom settings of the corresponding <code class="literal">Master</code> scan. Using this
		you can ensure source and calibrator are observed with the same settings, even after
		recalculating velocities and frequencies for a different date. The default setting of
		<code class="literal">null</code> leaves the settings independent of other scans.
	      </p>
	    </dd><dt><span class="term"><code class="literal">Comment</code></span></dt><dd>
	      <p>
		This field can be used to leave comments for yourself in the schedule. It is it not used
		on-line, nor is this entry available outside the scheduler.
	      </p>
	    </dd><dt><span class="term"><code class="literal">Wrap</code></span></dt><dd>
	      <p>
		The <acronym class="acronym">ATCA</acronym> can be in one of two &#8220;wraps&#8221;, and the azimuth
		ranges observable in each wrap are different, although they overlap. This field can be used
		if you want to control which wrap to use for your observations. It can take one of three values:
		<code class="literal">Closest</code>, <code class="literal">South</code> or <code class="literal">North</code>. See
		<a class="xref" href="ch02s03.html#scheduling-antenna-wraps" title="2.3.10. What are the antenna &#8220;wraps&#8221;?">Section 2.3.10</a> for a description of the wraps.

	      frequency closest to its centre. This frequency
	      must be within 1024 MHz of the frequency specified in the
	      <code class="literal">Continuum (MHz)</code> field. A maximum of 16 such bands
	      can be specified in the scheduler for each <acronym class="acronym">IF</acronym> when using a channel

	      This button brings up the velocity calculator that lets you specify the source velocity
	      and rest frequency to calculate the sky frequency of the spectral line. The sky frequency

	      the schedule when you press the <code class="literal">Apply</code> button.

	      This tick box appears on the velocity calculator. When ticked, the same velocity setting
	      will be used for all zooms on both frequencies. Use this to avoid having to enter the same
	      information many times when the source has many spectral lines with more or less the same velocity.
