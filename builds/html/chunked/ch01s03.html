	  In addition to the &#8220;normal&#8221; RFI in the 16cm band, as shown in
	  <a class="xref" href="ch01s03.html#rfi_survey_annotated" title="Figure 1.4. The ATCA 16cm RFI environment. Two surveys are shown, one from 2011 and the other from 2015. The licenses applicable to each frequency range are shown as coloured regions, labelled with a similar colour at the top of the plot.">Figure 1.4</a>, you may also see something dubbed
	  &#8220;mid-week RFI&#8221;. This RFI has frequency peaks around 1265 and 1300-1310 MHz,
	  and can have extremely high amplitudes. The RFI monitor can be used to see when mid-week RFI
	  is present, as shown in <a class="xref" href="ch01s03.html#rfi_monitor_midweek" title="Figure 1.8. A waterfall plot from the RFI monitor, showing what &#8220;mid-week RFI&#8221; can look like (in the brighter region).">Figure 1.8</a>. Because of the strength
	  of this RFI, it can often drive the front-end system of the 16cm receivers, or the CABB digitisers,
	  into saturation; if this occurs, the data becomes unusable. We do now sometimes receive advanced
	  warning on when this RFI may be present, and if this will affect observations, the investigators
	  will be notified so they can plan how to deal with it.

	  Only the 16cm band is affected by mid-week RFI, so if mid-week RFI is forecast during your
	  observations, you may wish to avoid using the 16cm band during those times, wherever possible.
	  If this is not possible, you may ask for a schedule swap, but this may not always be a
	  possibility. Our observations have also shown that mid-week RFI is present only for a small
	  fraction of the default CABB 10 second cycle time, but is so strong that it ruins the entire
	  integration. You may therefore be able to cope with mid-week RFI by running with a shorter cycle
	  time (say 1 or 2 seconds) and flagging those cycles in which the RFI is present; this will result
	  in a much higher data rate of course, and is only really suitable for continuum experiments that
	  do not need mosaicking.

	  The RFI present in the 4cm band is direction dependent, and can be quite variable over time.
	  Using a similar survey technique to the 16cm band, where the fringe-rotation is disabled, we can
	  determine the static levels of RFI. We also use the antennas to determine how directional the
	  RFI signals are, by doing the survey twice; once while the antennas are pointing at the

	  This geostationary satellite is at an azimuth of 341.5° and elevation of 53.1°, as
	  seen from the <acronym class="acronym">ATCA</acronym>. This corresponds to a declination of +6° 35&#8242;
	  and hour angle of +1h 14m (west of transit). This position is approximately 18.9° away from
	  pointing position of the antennas during the RFI survey, so the intensity of the interference can
	  be expected to be much higher than shown in <a class="xref" href="ch01s03.html#rfi_survey_15mm_equ" title="Figure 1.11. The 15mm band, as observed during an RFI survey from 2016-08-01, while the antennas were pointing at the celestial equator at transit.">Figure 1.11</a> for pointings
	  closer to the satellite.
	</p>

	<p>
	  The recommended <acronym class="acronym">CABB</acronym> continuum central frequencies for the 15mm band were 17 and 19 GHz,
	  but these may now contain a significant amount of RFI from &#8220;Sky Muster&#8221;, depending on
	  where your source is. If you are worried about this interference and wish to avoid it, we recommend
	  a new set of continuum central frequencies of 16.7 and 21.2 GHz. These recommended frequency bands
	  are not contiguous, but do avoid all the &#8220;Sky Muster&#8221; downlink emissions and in fact are
	  slightly more (between 3 and 10%) sensitive than the 17/19 GHz bands. If you need to use the 17/19 GHz
	  bands now in order to facilitate comparisons to data obtained in the past, you will likely need to
	  do extensive flagging during data reduction; the reduced bandwidth lost to flagging will also mean that
	  your continuum sensitivity suffers.

	  To avoid Solar interference, a rule-of-thumb is to observe at a time
	  of year when your source is further than about 40° from
	  the Sun, where possible. It is recommended to specify in your proposal
	  dates that are not suitable for observations if the Sun angle is too
	  small.  Low-frequency observations, particularly in spectral-line
	  mode, should be made at greater Solar separations. You are advised to observe
	  at night in cases where good quality 21cm HI data is essential
	  on the shortest (30m) baseline.  For spectral-line observations,
	  software exists in <span class="application">Miriad</span> to model and subtract out solar
	  interference. Some information about solar activity can be obtained
	  from the <a class="ulink" href="http://www.ips.gov.au/" target="_top">Ionospheric Prediction Service</a>.
