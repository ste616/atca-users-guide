      <p>
	<a class="indexterm" name="idm46395606806912"></a>
	During a normal observing run you will have to do calibration before you can
	start your observations, and then you will need to schedule time on one
	or more calibration sources.
      </p>

      <p>
	At the beginning of your observing run you may find that while observing a strong
	point source, the phases will not be constant as a function of frequency across the
	band; this indicates that the array requires delay calibration. To successfully perform
	delay calibration will require a point source of at least moderate brightness
	(<script type="math/tex">\mathrm{S} \gtrsim 1\mathrm{\,Jy}</script>).
	This is so the correlator can accurately determine the phase slope with frequency;
	the accuracy improves with the signal-to-noise ratio.
      </p>

      <p>
	The response of each antenna to the incoming radiation must also be determined, and
	this is comprised of bandpass and flux density calibration. This calibration can be
	done with only one source if the flux density of that source is known, it is a point
	source, and it is sufficiently bright. Otherwise a bright point source can be observed
	as the bandpass calibrator (the source used for the delay calibration can usually be
	used for this purpose), and a fainter source with a known flux density, or a
	planet can be used for flux density calibration.
      </p>

      <p>
	Over the duration of the experiment, several factors that affect the antenna
	response will change. These include atmospheric phase, opacity, elevation-dependent
	dish surface distortions and focus changes, aperture illumination and spillover.
	To monitor these changes you will need to observe a point source nearby to your
	science target. This point source will need to be reasonably bright, but averaging
	over a short period of time can be used if the nearest source isn't very bright.
      </p>

      <p>
	If you need to measure the polarisation of your science target, you will want
	to determine the leakage parameters; the fraction of linearly-polarised photons
	that are detected by the receptor that should not.
      </p>

      <p>
	If you are observing at high frequency, where the primary beam of the antenna
	is small, it is important that the maximum response of the beam is directed
	toward the source you're observing. To ensure this is the case, you should do
	periodic pointing-correction scans on a nearby point source of reasonable
	brightness.
      </p>

      <p>
	Finally, if you're observing in the 3mm band, you will need to use the
	receiver's absorber paddle to keep track of how the system temperature varies
	over time. This is done periodically on-line using &#8220;paddle&#8221;
	scans.

	For more detail on each of these types of calibration, read the sections
	below. It is important to note that you must repeat all the calibration for
	every frequency configuration that you observe, as it is not generally possible to
	interpolate or extrapolate the calibration parameters determined from one frequency
	configuration to another.

      <p>
	<a class="indexterm" name="idm46395606770304"></a>
	The calibrator you use to calibrate the delays is largely dependent on the
	band you are observing in, and the <acronym class="acronym">LST</acronym> when you are setting up.
      </p>

      <p>
	For the centimetre bands (16cm and 4cm), delay calibration is best done with one of
	two sources. When the LST is between 11:00 and 04:18, you should use PKS 1934-638 to calibrate
	the delays, because it is strong and you'll need to observe it anyway for flux
	density calibration purposes. At all other times you should use 0823-500.
      </p>

      <p>
	For the higher frequency bands, you will need to use one of the many available bright
	sources in the <acronym class="acronym">ATCA</acronym> calibrator database, such as:
	</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul class="itemizedlist" style="list-style-type: disc; "><li class="listitem"><p>0003-066</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>0420-014</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>0537-441</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>0727-115</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>1034-293</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>1253-055</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>1424-418</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>1613-586</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>1921-293</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>2155-152</p></li></ul></div><p>
	You should choose whichever is highest, or nearest to your targets. There are many more
	sources that are bright in the millimetre bands, and you can search for the brightest
	calibrators using the <acronym class="acronym">ATCA</acronym> calibrator database search interface.

    <div class="section"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a name="calibration-bandpass"></a>2.2.3. How do I calibrate the bandpass response of the antennas?</h3></div></div></div>
      

      <p>
	<a class="indexterm" name="idm46395606757344"></a>
	<a class="indexterm" name="idm46395606756032"></a>
	The bandpass calibration is best done with a very bright source, since you're trying to
	precisely determine how each frequency channel responds to a known amount of flux density.
      </p>

      <p>
	To do this ideally, the response should be dominated by the signal rather than the
	thermal noise in each channel. Since this is also a very useful property for a
	delay calibrator to have, the same calibrators that can be used for delay calibration
	(<a class="xref" href="ch02s02.html#calibration-delays" title="2.2.2. What sources can be used for delay calibration?">Section 2.2.2</a>) are ideal for bandpass calibration as
	well. If the bandpass calibrators is used as the delay calibrator, then the bandpass 
	calibration observation can be made immediately following
	the completion of the setup without further slewing overhead.
	If the observations are at 3mm, a paddle measurement should be
	made immediately before the bandpass observation.
      </p>
      
      <p>
	As the receiver response does not change greatly as a function of time, for a
	continuum observation it is
	usually sufficient to make an observation of a bandpass calibrator at the very start of
	the allocated time. The amount of time spent
	integrating on the bandpass calibrator depends on its flux, but generally 5-10 minutes
	is sufficient at all frequencies. 
      </p>

      <p>
	For spectral line observations though, it has been noted that the <acronym class="acronym">CABB</acronym> 
	bandpass is not perfectly stable over the
	course of a normal 12 hour observation, and for this reason it is advisable
	to observe a bandpass calibrator more than once per observation. Visiting it
	three times (once at the start, once at the end, and once sometime near the
	middle) during a 12 hour observation should be sufficient to obtain a reliable
	bandpass solution. Alternatively, provided the gain calibrator is reasonably
	bright, the periodic visits to it may provide accurate enough information to
	determine how the bandpass solution changes over time.
      </p>

      <p>
	The integration time spent on the bandpass calibrator will have an effect on
	the accuracy of the flux that is measured after reduction. It is necessary to
	obtain each correlator channel's flux to the same accuracy as required for the
	flux calibrator, ie. obtain a signal-to-noise ratio of 100 <span class="emphasis"><em>per channel</em></span>
	if the required flux accuracy is 1%. Since any point source can be a bandpass calibrator,
	the sensitivity calculator should be used
	to find out the RMS noise per channel for your observations, and then a calibrator
	found from the calibrator database that provides enough flux to meet the signal-to-noise
	ratio requirements. For example, a typical <acronym class="acronym">CABB</acronym> observation has 2048 channels,
	and at 50 GHz, the RMS noise per channel is about 35 mJy for a 5 minute observation.
	For a signal-to-noise ratio of 100, a calibrator with flux greater than 3.5 Jy is
	required, and a search through the calibrator database identifies 19 such sources.
	Of course, if a primary flux calibrator is strong enough to be a bandpass calibrator
	as well, then observing time can be conserved by not having a separate bandpass
	calibrator.

	<a class="indexterm" name="idm46395606744560"></a>
	Flux density calibration is required to translate the arbitrary gain scaling that is produced by
	an observation to an absolute flux density scale. The most effective way of doing this is by
	observing a calibrator that has a known flux density (on the absolute flux density scale) and comparing
	it to the sources that you are observing that have unknown flux densities.
      </p>

      <p>
	For the <acronym class="acronym">ATCA</acronym>, there are currently only four flux density calibrators, and of those only two
	are regularly used.
      </p>

      <p>
	<a class="indexterm" name="idm46395606741872"></a>
	For frequencies between 1 GHz and 25 GHz, the preferred flux density calibrator is PKS 1934-638.
	It has a known, stable flux, and conveniently has no linear or circular polarisation, at least
	at low frequencies.
	The flux density model for 1934-638 that is installed in <span class="application">Miriad</span> are 
	based on the models described in the memo

	The high-frequency model has been shown by Partridge et al. (2016) to match quite well with the
	<acronym class="acronym">VLA</acronym>, but unfortunately the low-frequency model does not.
      </p>

      <p>
	For frequencies higher than 50 GHz you can use 1934-638 as the flux density calibrator, but the planet Uranus
	is brighter. Its flux density is known to vary with time, but it does so in a way that is understood and can
	be modelled. The planets Mars and Neptune can also be used, but Uranus is preferred
	because its angular size is smaller than Mars (making it easier to observe with typical
	Compact Array baselines), and it is brighter than Neptune (which would require a longer
	scan to provide the same signal-to-noise level).
      </p>

      <p>
	<a class="indexterm" name="idm46395606724576"></a>
	To be as effective as possible, the flux density calibrator should be observed when it is at the
	same elevation as the target source, and at as high an elevation as possible. Doing this
	means that any gain-elevation dependence
	is reduced, and the effect of airmass is also reduced. At low frequencies (below 7 GHz),
	these requirements are not as important as they are for higher frequencies, where the
	atmospheric effects become a large factor. Indeed, many (if not most) centimetre observers
	simply make a scan on 1934-638 at the beginning of their observations, and this is usually
	good enough to get a flux density uncertainty of only a few percent.
      </p>

      <p>
	Because 1934-638 is a point source (at least at the resolution of the Compact Array), it
	can be observed the same way as any other calibrator. That is, a scan on 1934-638 should
	be included in the schedule, and should be preceded by a pointing scan when it is observed
	with the 15mm or 7mm receivers.
      </p>

      <p>
	Observing the planets is a little more complicated. Because they are not point sources on
	even the most compact of <acronym class="acronym">ATCA</acronym> baselines, they cannot be used as a pointing reference. A
	nearby source must therefore be used to determine the pointing offsets before observing
	the planet. Also, because the planets will substantially fill the primary beam of the
	<acronym class="acronym">ATCA</acronym> antenna, the apparent system temperature of the antenna will be increased while
	a planet is being observed. Because of this, if a paddle scan is made while observing a
	planet, the system temperature will not be correctly determined, and the flux scaling will
	be in error. When observing with the 3mm system therefore, the paddle scan should be made
	while observing the same nearby pointing reference calibrator.
      </p>

	  <p>
	    Observe the calibrator again for 2 minutes.
	  </p>
	</li></ul></div>
      <p>
	The procedure is similar for the other planets. Note that because the phases of the nearby
	calibrator are not used by the <span class="application">Miriad</span> flux calibration task 
	<span class="command"><strong>mfboot</strong></span>, it is not
	absolutely necessary to bracket the planet with a calibrator observation. It can however
	be useful to have that data to diagnose potential problems, should they arise.
	<a class="indexterm" name="idm46395606709920"></a>
      </p>

      <p>
	The integration time spent on the flux density calibrator is largely governed by the 
	precision required for the observations to be successful, and the strength of the primary flux 
	density calibrator at the observing frequency. If a flux density precision of 1% is required, then the aim
	should be to make an observation with a signal-to-noise ratio of 100. For a
	observation with 2 GHz bandwidth, this is relatively easy, as even
	a 5 minute observation of 1934-638 at 50 GHz gives a signal-to-noise ratio in
	excess of 1000.
      </p>
      
      <p>
	The sensitivity calculator should be used to estimate the observing time required to achieve the desired
	flux density precision. However, it is never a bad idea to pad the required time out a little
	to ensure that enough good data will remain after flagging.

      <p>
	<a class="indexterm" name="idm46395606704272"></a>
	The gain parameters that vary significantly over time include:
	</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul class="itemizedlist" style="list-style-type: disc; "><li class="listitem"><p>atmospheric phase</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>atmospheric opacity</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>forward gain due to structural deformation</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>aperture illumination</p></li></ul></div><p>
	As these factors vary, the path lengths between the antennas will vary
	(which varies the phase), and the system temperatures may change, thus
	changing the sensitivity. To accurately correct for these changes, they must
	be regularly monitored.
      </p>

      <p>
	<a class="indexterm" name="idm46395606699568"></a>
	<a class="indexterm" name="idm46395606698064"></a>
	The best way to monitor these changing parameters is to observe a
	simple source (a point source in an otherwise empty field is the ideal case)
	every time the observing configuration (elevation, weather, etc.) changes
	significantly. The definition of &#8220;significant&#8221; change
	depends on the observing frequency and the observing conditions (such as
	array configuration, atmospheric seeing, temperature, precipitation etc.).
	More precisely,
	by observing a source that looks the same irrespective of time or (u,v)
	coordinates, changes in gain can be determined directly. Therefore, gain calibrators
	should be unresolved, with a stable flux over the observation timescale.

	For example, for an observation at 19 GHz, with a seeing RMS of 300 microns, in a
	750m array, the calculator determines that if the gain calibrator was visited every
	2 minutes, the observations would have an RMS phase of 15°, be decorrelated
	by 3%, and have a maximum dynamic range of just 282. However it also determines that
	this is as bad as it gets, so that a 10 minute visit interval would give the same results.
	Since 2 minutes is a very frequent visit schedule, it would seem that self-calibration
	would be preferable for high dynamic range observations.
      </p>
      
      <p>
	Dropping the seeing RMS to 100 microns (which would be a good winter day)
	improves matters significantly, allowing a dynamic range of 874 with no decorrelation and a
	5° RMS phase for any visit interval greater than 2 minutes.
      </p>
      
      <p>
	It is important however not to extend the interval too far, as then the atmosphere
	being sampled by the gain calibrator will be different to that the source has sampled
	during that time. For cm observations, one might need only visit the gain calibrator
	once or twice per hour in good conditions, while for mm observations, it is unwise
	to visit the calibrator less frequently than once every 15 minutes.

	The <acronym class="acronym">ATCA</acronym> has a large list of gain calibrators, spread over the viewable sky. This list
	can be queried using a 
	<a class="ulink" href="http://www.narrabri.atnf.csiro.au/calibrators/" target="_top">web interface</a>.
	  This interface queries the database in one of three ways:
      </p>
      <div class="itemizedlist"><ul class="itemizedlist" style="list-style-type: bullet; "><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc">

	    <span class="bold"><strong>Quick-find calibrator</strong></span>: finds a calibrator with a specified name.
	    The quick-find box will show all sources that match the string you enter into it.
	    For example, there
	    are five sources in the database which match with &#8220;0537&#8221;: 0537-441, 0537-158, 0537-286,
	    J0537-3357 and 0537+531. When this list of sources is displayed, you can click on the one you want

	Selection of an appropriate gain calibrator can also be done while you are preparing
	the schedule in the <acronym class="acronym">CABB</acronym> web scheduler (see
	<a class="xref" href="ch02s03.html#Continuum-Schedule-Example" title="2.3.12. Could I see an example continuum schedule file?">Section 2.3.12</a> for an example of how this works).
	Ideally, choose the nearest possible point source calibrator to your target.
	Sometimes that calibrator may not be very bright though, and you may wish to
	choose a brighter calibrator that is further away in order to lessen your
	overhead: a brighter calibrator can give a good measurement of the gain in a
	shorter time than a dimmer calibrator. For continuum observations this is largely
	irrelevant since the large <acronym class="acronym">CABB</acronym> bandwidths allow for a very
	accurate measure of gain in just a few cycles. For spectral line observations though,
	the brighter the source the better.

      <p>
	<a class="indexterm" name="idm46395606669280"></a>
	The <acronym class="acronym">ATCA</acronym> uses dual linear orthogonal feeds to measure the incident radiation.
	Ideally, these two feeds would be independent: in reality
	this is not the case, and a fraction of the radiation measured by one feed is also
	receiver by the other; this effect is called &#8220;leakage&#8221;. Polarisation calibration is primarily concerned
	with measuring the leakage fraction and the possibly non-zero signal phase (the so-called
	XY-phase) between the two feeds.
      </p>

      <p>
	A paper by Sault and Cornwell (1999, in &#8220;Synthesis Imaging in Radio Astronomy II&#8221;,
	ASP Conf. 180, p657) showed that for an observation where a calibrator with apriori unknown
	polarisation properties can be observed with at least three different parallactic angles (what they
	call the &#8220;parallactic angle rotation trick&#8221;), polarisation calibration is required
	to determine the absolute alignment of linear polarisation angle and the term which causes leakage
	between Stokes I and V.
      </p>

      <p>
	<a class="indexterm" name="idm46395606665856"></a>
	The absolute alignment of linear polarisations is achieved by injecting a linearly
	polarised signal at 45° to the linear orthogonal feeds several times per second: this
	is known as the &#8220;noise diode&#8221;. This signal is measured by the correlator on each
	antenna, and the XY-phase is used later in data reduction to determine the absolute linear polarisation
	angle. All the receivers except for the 3mm system have a noise diode on each antenna. For 3mm
	observations, CA02 has got the Mopra spare receiver installed, which has a noise diode, while all
	other antennas do not. Should Mopra require the spare at any point however, this capability may
	be removed from the <acronym class="acronym">ATCA</acronym>; in this case you would need to use a different
	observational strategy to recover the absolute alignment information.
      </p>

      <p>
	<a class="indexterm" name="idm46395606663248"></a>
	<a class="indexterm" name="idm46395606663120"></a>
	This means that to complete the linear polaristion calibration, any of the point source calibrators in the
	<acronym class="acronym">ATCA</acronym> calibrator database can be observed at least a few times over the course of an
	Earth-rotation synthesis observation. Since this is likely being done for normal gain calibration,
	most observations will contain enough information to calibrate the linear polarisation.
      </p>

      <p>
	If you can't play the parallactic angle rotation trick (if for instance you are observing for only
	a short time), then you will need to know the polarisation parameters for the calibrators you are
	observing. At low frequencies (in the 16cm band), it is known that PKS B1934-638 has zero linear
	polarisation. For short observations then, you can use the flux density calibration observations
	to calibrate linear polarisation as well.

    <div class="section"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a name="idm46395606656048"></a>2.2.7. When is pointing calibration required?</h3></div></div></div>
      

      <p>
	<a class="indexterm" name="idm46395606654016"></a>
	The global pointing model for the <acronym class="acronym">ATCA</acronym> antennas is usually good to a few
	arcseconds under ideal conditions, and the tracking accuracy is better than an arcsecond.
	But changes in temperature can make the pointing model incorrect by a few 10s of arcseconds,
	and this would mean that for the millimetre bands the pointing may be incorrect by a
	significant fraction of the primary beam size (see <a class="xref" href="ch01s02.html#table_sensitivity" title="Table 1.1. Observing Parameters for the 6km Compact Array.">Table 1.1</a>).
	This would adversely affect the sensitivity of the observations of your targets.
      </p>

      <p>
	<a class="indexterm" name="idm46395606651232"></a>
	<a class="indexterm" name="idm46395606649984"></a>
	While observing, you can correct the pointing model to ensure that the peak response of the
	primary beam is pointing directly at your target. A pointing correction scan is made by
	observing a reasonably bright point source directly and at the half-power point of the
	primary beam in each of the azimuth and elevation axes, and comparing the amplitude seen at
	each of these points.
      </p>

      <p>
	<a class="indexterm" name="idm46395606648176"></a>
	With 2 GHz of bandwidth, almost any point source in the <acronym class="acronym">ATCA</acronym> calibrator
	database can be used to determine the pointing corrections, however the pointing corrections
	only really improve the global pointing model within 20° of the azimuth/elevation at
	which the corrections were determined. The natural choice of calibrator for this purpose
	is therefore the same as for the gain calibration, and in general you should use your
	gain calibrator for pointing calibration.
      </p>

      <p>
	Because the pointing corrections are only valid with 20°, a pointing correction scan
	will be required approximately every hour while you're observing if you're tracking the same
	source as it crosses the sky, or more frequently if you're observing multiple sources across
	the sky.

    <div class="section"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a name="idm46395606645184"></a>2.2.8. When is paddle calibration required?</h3></div></div></div>
      

      <p>
	<a class="indexterm" name="idm46395606643408"></a>	
	The &#8220;paddle&#8221; is a mechanical arm that holds an absorbing material large
	enough to cover the 3mm feed horn. By observing the paddle, the temperature of which is assumed
	to be the ambient temperature in the antenna vertex room (which is monitored), and comparing it
	to the assumed temperature of the mostly empty sky, you get a system temperature that includes
	the effect of the atmosphere. This is sometimes referred to as the &#8220;above-the-atmosphere&#8221;
	system temperature, because in this case the system includes the atmosphere.
      </p>

      <p>
	Because changes to the system temperature affect the response of the system to an otherwise
	equivalent amount of radiation, it is important to keep track of these changes as your observations
	progress. With the other receivers, the injected noise signal (the temperature of which is assumed to
	stay constant) is monitored constantly, and no overhead is incurred for sytem temperature monitoring.
	For observations with the 3mm receiver however, you will need to observe the paddle reasonably
	frequently and incur a couple of minutes overhead each time you do.
      </p>

      <p>
	How often the paddle is used depends on the conditions. Since in principle you are using the paddle
	scans to interpolate the actual system temperature at any particular point in time during your observations,
	you will need to observe the paddle frequently enough to catch any departures from a linear change
	to the system temperature. If you are observing in good and stable weather, you can go 20 minutes between paddle
	scans. If the atmosphere is very turbulent though you may have to use the paddle more often.
      </p>

      <p>
	It is important to remember that the system temperature calculation depends on the assumption that
	it will be looking at mostly empty sky after it looks at the paddle. For most point source calibrators
	this assumption will be valid, but if you are pointing at a planet, the system response will include
	its temperature, and this will affect the system temperature calculations.
