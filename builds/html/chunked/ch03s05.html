    <p>
      We realise that observers are busy people who cannot always be in front of their observing computer for
      the entire duration of their experiment. The observatory can be operated in &#8220;unattended&#8221;
      mode when it is convenient to do so. This section describes how best to observe in this way, and what
      is expected from you during your experiment.
    </p>
    <div class="section"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a name="idm46395605118080"></a>3.5.1. Unattended Observing - Definition</h3></div></div></div>
      
      <p>
	When we talk about &#8220;unattended observing&#8221;, we mean any period during your experiment
	where you are not immediately aware of the state of the telescope. You may be any distance away from
	your observing computer, or asleep, or otherwise engaged in another activity, but you are listed as
	the &#8220;observer in charge&#8221; on the <acronym class="acronym">ATCA</acronym> Portal.
      </p>
    </div>
    <div class="section"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a name="idm46395605115296"></a>3.5.2. Observatory Expectations</h3></div></div></div>
      
      <p>
	The observatory does not require you to be responsible for the safety of the telescope equipment or
	of personnel. We have sophisticated systems and procedures which should handle any unsafe situation
	that might arise during a normal observation. For example, the automated systems will turn on the
	generators when a storm is approaching, and turn them off when it passes. It will also automatically
	handle stowing in periods of high wind, or when there is a high chance of lightning strike.
      </p>
      <p>
	We do however expect that you are solely responsible for monitoring the quality of your data, and we
	do expect to be able to contact you via the phone number you supplied when you registered as the
	observer in charge. You should consider how often you need to check your data quality, given how much
	time you could lose if something goes wrong.
      </p>
      <p>
	For example, if an antenna stops tracking due to a drive fault, you may call the duty astronomer and
	have them call the on-call person to remedy the situation; it might take only 10 minutes to rectify the
	problem if you were immediately aware of the fault. If you were asleep at the time of the fault however,
	you may lose a lot more than 10 minutes, and you would be ineligible to be compensated for that time.
	We recommend that even while sleeping through an observation, a periodic check is made every couple of
	hours.

    <div class="section"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a name="unattended-alarms"></a>3.5.3. Alarm notification during unattended observing</h3></div></div></div>
      
      <p>
	We have developed several systems to proactively reach out to observers when something goes wrong that
	might need urgent action. This section describes the unattended observing alarm notification system available for the
	<acronym class="acronym">ATCA</acronym>.
      </p>
      <div class="section"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h4 class="title"><a name="idm46395605107616"></a>3.5.3.1. Assistance</h4></div></div></div>
	
	<p>
	  Whenever <span class="command"><strong>assistance</strong></span> detects a problem with the telescope hardware, or with the
	  visibilities, it will make an audible alert - a bell sound - every 10 seconds while the fault is
	  still present and not ignored. If you are sleeping, we recommend ensuring that you have the volume
	  up loud enough for this bell so that it will wake you if necessary.
	</p>
      </div>
      <div class="section"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h4 class="title"><a name="idm46395605104496"></a>3.5.3.2. MoniCA</h4></div></div></div>
	
	<p>
	  The MoniCA client has something called the &#8220;alarm manager&#8221;, which monitors many of
	  the critical telescope systems. If a problem is found, it will start making sounds which
	  approximate a robot saying &#8220;ATTENTION&#8221;. Again, we recommend that this be set up
	  whenever you are within earshot of the computer, but are not paying attention to it.
	</p>
      </div>
      <div class="section"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h4 class="title"><a name="twitter-alarms"></a>3.5.3.3. Twitter feed</h4></div></div></div>
	
	<p>
	  The same alarms that will be displayed in the MoniCA alarm manager will also be turned into tweets on the
	  <acronym class="acronym">ATCA</acronym> <a class="ulink" href="https://twitter.com/jamie_atca_sss" target="_top">Twitter feed</a>. This should
	  allow you to be a long way from your observing computer and still be alerted to problems with the telescope.
	  Whenever an alarm is generated
	  by <span class="application">MoniCA</span>, or an alarm status goes away, a message is posted to the Twitter
	  feed describing the problem.
	</p>
	<div class="figure"><a name="twitter-tweets"></a><div class="figure-contents">
	  
	  <div class="mediaobject"><img src="figures/tweets_example.jpg" alt="Some example tweets from the ATCA alarm Twitter feed."></div>
	</div><p class="title"><b>Figure 3.9. Some example tweets from the <a class="ulink" href="https://twitter.com/jamie_atca_sss" target="_top">ATCA alarm Twitter
	  feed</a>.</b></p></div><br class="figure-break">
	<p>
	  A couple of example tweets are shown in <a class="xref" href="ch03s05.html#twitter-tweets" title="Figure 3.9. Some example tweets from the ATCA alarm Twitter feed.">Figure 3.9</a>. Each tweet starts
	  with the UTC date and time that the alarm state changed. The date is listed as year-month-day, but
	  where the century part is omitted, to save characters. All alarms are given the hashtag
	  <code class="literal">#ALARM</code>; this may currently seem redundant, but this Twitter feed will likely be
	  expanded to include problems that do not generate <span class="application">MoniCA</span> alarm states.
	</p>
	<p>
	  If an alarm has been triggered, then the next part of the tweet will be a hashtag describing how
	  important the alarm is. An <code class="literal">#INFORMATION</code> alarm simply presents a condition report,
	  but likely does not require any action. <code class="literal">#MINOR</code> alarms can be ignored until
	  it is convenient, where you should probably investigate <code class="literal">#MAJOR</code> and
	  <code class="literal">#SEVERE</code> alarms as quickly as possible.
	</p>
	<p>
	  If an alarm state has gone away, there will be no severity hashtag.
	</p>
	<p>
	  The rest of the tweet is then some guidance text about which system has caused the alarm. The
	  guidance text is not designed to help you respond to or correct the problem; training on how
	  to deal with problems that arise with the <acronym class="acronym">ATCA</acronym> is still required. Rather,
	  the tweet is there to quickly alert you to the problem.
	</p>
	<p>
	  The Twitter feed is still under active development, to make it as useful for observers as possible.
	  All feedback about your experiences with the Twitter feed is welcome, as are suggestions on ways
	  in which it can be made more useful.
	</p>

      <div class="section"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h4 class="title"><a name="getting-notifications"></a>3.5.3.4. Getting notifications from Twitter</h4></div></div></div>
	
	<p>
	  The alarm notification system is based around Twitter because of the variety of methods
	  available to receive tweets on mobile devices. The simplest way of course is to install the
	  official Twitter client on your mobile device, and subscribe to the
	  <code class="literal">@jamie_atca_sss</code> Twitter feed from your account. In that way, you can make
	  your mobile device respond in one of several ways to any alarm tweets.
	</p>
	<p>
	  If you'd rather not set up a Twitter account, you can quite easily get tweets via the Twitter
	  <acronym class="acronym">SMS</acronym> system. This way, you can still be notified of alarms when you have your
	  phone with you. The official Twitter <acronym class="acronym">SMS</acronym> service can be used as described
	  <a class="ulink" href="https://support.twitter.com/articles/20170004" target="_top">on the SMS follow web page</a>.
	  For example, for Australians, you may get the alarm tweets via <acronym class="acronym">SMS</acronym> by sending
	  an <acronym class="acronym">SMS</acronym> &#8220;<code class="literal">follow jamie_atca_sss</code>&#8221;
	  (without the quotes) to the number
	  <code class="literal">0198089488</code>. You will then get a return message if this has been successful, that
	  will also tell you how to stop following. In addition, you'll get the most recent tweet from the
	  alarm feed.
	</p>
	<p>
	  You can also use the free online web service
	  <a class="ulink" href="https://ifttt.com" target="_top"><acronym class="acronym">IFTTT</acronym> (if-this-then-that)</a>
	  to respond in a customisable way to tweets from the ATCA alarm system. You will need to sign
	  up to <acronym class="acronym">IFTTT</acronym>, and connect your Twitter account to their
	  <a class="ulink" href="https://ifttt.com/twitter" target="_top">Twitter channel</a>, but after that you may specify any
	  number of ways to get notification of tweets from the alarm system. For example, there is
	  <a class="ulink" href="https://ifttt.com/recipes/424650-atca-alarms-to-sms" target="_top">a published recipe</a> that
	  takes an alarm tweet and sends you an <acronym class="acronym">SMS</acronym>. But you could also make your smart
	  lights at home turn red, or get a phone call (in certain regions only).
	</p>
	<p>
	  Using <acronym class="acronym">IFTTT</acronym> may also be a more convenient way to get <acronym class="acronym">SMS</acronym> from
	  the alarm feed, because you can easily turn it on or off via the web interface or their
	  mobile app, rather than having to send an <acronym class="acronym">SMS</acronym> each time you want to start
	  or stop getting alarm notifications.
