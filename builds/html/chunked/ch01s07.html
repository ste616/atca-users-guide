	You may not wish to make detailed high resolution images but instead,
	for example, survey a large number of compact or simple sources. Under
	these circumstances, if the sources are strong enough, short
	observations will suffice (<a class="xref" href="ch01s07.html#table_image_structure" title="Table 1.5. Largest well-imaged structure at 6cm wavelength.">Table 1.5</a>).  In scheduling
	these, slew time becomes an important consideration; these may be
	calculated see <a class="xref" href="ch01s07.html#Mosaicing" title="1.7.3. Mosaicing">Section 1.7.3</a>, or
	with the use of the CABB scheduler. A single short observation in an
	E-W array will give a 1-dimensional (u,v)-coverage; two or more
	short observations will give some 2-dimensional information.  In such
	short observations consequent higher sidelobe levels will exacerbate
	problems caused by confusing sources in the primary beam. Because the
	Compact Array has poor (u,v)-coverage, in contrast to its good
	sensitivity, this confusion makes it difficult to reach the receiver
	noise limit when observing weak sources or searching for detections,
	particularly at lower frequencies. Current experience suggests that at
	6cm at least 8 short observations well distributed in hour angle are
	needed to reduce confusion to the noise level.  At 16cm, short
	observations are unlikely to ever reach the noise limit.

	Two orthogonal linear polarisations are measured simultaneously. The
	position angle of the polarisation splitter is stationary with respect
	to the alt-az&#8211;mounted antennas and so rotates on the sky. A suite of
	tasks in <span class="application">Miriad</span> is available for polarimetric calibration of Compact
	Array data.  No specific calibrators, other than the usual flux and
	gain calibrators, are needed for polarisation calibration. An
	observation of B1934-638 is essential when only making short
	observations.  Small drifts with time can be corrected for using the
	on-line measurements of the <span class="emphasis"><em>XY</em></span> phase differences to an accuracy
	of 0.5 degrees at all bands.  Best polarimetric calibration results
	<a class="indexterm" name="idm46395607126448"></a>
	when the gain calibrator is observed at a good sampling of
	different parallactic angles.
      </p>

      <p>
	<a class="indexterm" name="idm46395607124944"></a>
	<span class="application">Miriad</span> is routinely used to calibrate data in all bands, with
	consistent results being achieved over several months in the cm bands.
	The on-axis instrumental polarisation is typically below 2-3%.  After
	calibrating for instrumental polarisation, we are currently able to
	reduce on-axis instrumental effects to 0.1%, and better with some
	care. Procedures for 3mm polarisation observations are still being
	established.
      </p>

      <p>
	<a class="indexterm" name="idm46395607122688"></a>
	The off-axis polarisation increases roughly as the square of the
	distance from the pointing centre at least up to the half-power point.
	At 16, 6 and 3cm, the instrumental polarisation is about 3%,
	1.6% and 3% of the <span class="emphasis"><em>apparent</em></span> total intensity at the half
	power point, respectively. At 16 and 6cm this error is almost purely
	linearly polarised (there is no circularly polarised component),
	whereas at 3cm the circularly polarised component is somewhat
	less than 1% at the half-power point.
	
	
	Because the <acronym class="acronym">ATCA</acronym> antennas have an alt-az mount, the off-axis response
	varies with parallactic angle, and will be smeared out by a factor of
	<a class="indexterm" name="idm46395607119344"></a>
	a few by a long synthesis. This smearing is a function of
	declination. The <span class="application">Miriad</span> task <span class="command"><strong>offpol</strong></span> can be used to simulate off-axis
	polarimetric response of a long synthesis observation.  Mosaicing
	smears out the off-axis response still further, by as much as an order
	of magnitude.
      </p>
      <p>
	<a class="indexterm" name="idm46395607117200"></a>
	At 16cm, instrumental polarisation is largely independent of frequency,
	due to a recent upgrade of the receivers and OMTs. The leakages are now
	flat to better than 2% across the entire usable band. More detail on the
	polarisation properties of the <acronym class="acronym">ATCA</acronym> 16cm receivers can be found in the
	receiver commissioning report. 
	
	Leakages of more than 10% occur at 4550 ± 10,
	5328 ± 10 MHz and 8780 ± 10 MHz. Data near these
	frequencies may need to be flagged.

	Objects which are of similar size or larger than the primary beam will need
	to be <em class="firstterm">mosaiced</em>. In such cases, the recommended spacing of pointing
	centres is half of the primary beamwidth. The Compact Array antennas
	and control system allow for rapid switching between pointing centres
	&#8212; as frequently as once per integration cycle. This enables a source
	to be rapidly mosaiced without necessarily losing
	(u,v)-coverage.  In mosaicing mode, data is not recorded when
	antennas are driving between fields. The antenna acceleration limit is
	800 deg/min/min, and the slew limit is 38 deg/min in azimuth and 19
	deg/min in elevation. Mosaicing mode may also be useful for observing
	<a class="indexterm" name="idm46395607110560"></a>
	large numbers of nearby sources, as the observing overheads are
	reduced.
      </p>

      <p>
	There is also a facility for &#8220;on-the-fly" mosaicing, whereby the
	antennas are continuously driven. This type of mosaicing may be
	especially useful for large-area mosaics at low frequencies, where
	the drive times between mosaic pointings are significant.

	<a class="indexterm" name="idm46395607104064"></a>
	As (u,v)-distance is proportional to frequency as well as
	baseline length, different (u,v)-spacings can be obtained not
	only by varying the antenna configuration, but also by varying the
	frequency.
      </p>

      <p>
	<a class="indexterm" name="idm46395607102240"></a>
	Additional (u,v)-coverage can be obtained in the mm bands by
	observing at multiple frequencies.  Observing at two frequencies has
	the added advantage of increasing sensitivity, as they can be observed
	simultaneously.  Observing more than two frequencies requires time
	sharing. While this will not improve the sensitivity further, it can
	significantly improve the (u,v)-coverage. However, there is a
	trade off between gaps in the tangential and radial directions in the
	(u,v)-plane.  Typically two or three pairs of frequencies,
	observing each setting for 10 minutes, is a good compromise.
      </p>
      
      <p>
	<a class="indexterm" name="idm46395607099920"></a>
	When you use both bandwidth synthesis and two or three configurations,
	and require (u,v)-coverage to 6km, the best choice of
	configurations is not two or three 6km arrays, but a combination of
	6km with 1.5km and 750m arrays (all arrays using the 6km antenna).
	
	
	
	The flux density of most sources will often vary significantly between different
	frequencies and, furthermore, this variation itself (i.e., the
	spectral index) will vary across the source. This complicates the task
	<a class="indexterm" name="idm46395607097408"></a>
	of combining data from the different frequencies when you want
	high-dynamic-range images. However software is available in <span class="application">Miriad</span> to
	account for the spectral variations in the imaging, deconvolution and
	self-calibration steps. These algorithms solve for, or use, both a
	basic flux-density image and a spectral-index image. For typical
	spectral indices, they are appropriate for frequency ratios less than
	about 1.25.

	After each antenna reconfiguration a pointing solution is determined.
	Generally, rms errors of around 5 arcsec are achieved at this time.
	These solutions degrade with thermal (and other) effects. By the time
	observations are undertaken, rms errors of about 10 arcsec (or more) are likely.
	There is a significant offset (of up to 30 arcsecs) between the mm and the cm receivers.
      </p>

      <p>
	<a class="indexterm" name="idm46395607089040"></a>
	A reference pointing mode is available which is recommended for mm observations.
	In this mode, a 1 Jy
	calibrator, about 5° to 10° away from the
	target will hold the pointing to 10 arcsec rms.  A bright (say 5 Jy)
	calibrator at 2° to 3° from the target will
	reduce the errors to about 5 arcsec rms. A reference pointing scan
	generally takes 3-4 minutes to complete. See the
	<a class="ulink" href="http://www.narrabri.atnf.csiro.au/observing/pointing" target="_top">Reference Pointing Guide</a>
