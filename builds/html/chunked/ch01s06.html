      which should be read before reading this section.

    <div class="section"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a name="15mm-Observations"></a>1.6.1. 15mm Observations</h3></div></div></div>
      
      <p>
	All six antennas of the Compact Array are equipped with 15mm receivers
	covering the frequency range 16&#8211;25 GHz.  The 15mm system shares a
	common dewar with the 7mm and 3mm receivers, and the separate feed horns
	at the top of the dewar are moved to the Cassegrain focus of the
	Compact Array antennas using the rotator positioning system. Because
	the 15, 7 and 3 mm receivers have separate feed horns, observations
	cannot be simultaneous between the 15, 7 and 3 mm bands.
      </p>
    </div>

    <div class="section"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a name="7mm-Observations"></a>1.6.2. 7mm Observations</h3></div></div></div>
      
      <p>
	The <acronym class="acronym">ATCA</acronym> can observe within the frequency range 30&#8211;50GHz.  Feeds and
	receivers were installed into the existing mm-wave receiver packages on
	all 6 antennas in 2007, with the 7mm upgrade jointly funded by the
	<acronym class="acronym">ATNF</acronym> and NASA's Deep Space Network to enable the <acronym class="acronym">ATCA</acronym> to participate
	in occasional spacecraft tracking.
      </p>

      <p>
	The wide 7mm band presents difficulties in signal down-conversion,
	<a class="indexterm" name="idm46395607198224"></a>
	as the aliased signal from the first down conversion stage can also
	be within the 7mm band. Although image rejection filters are used,
	variations in receiver gain across the band, combined with the
	frequency-dependent performance of the filters themselves, can result
	in appreciable signal levels being added to the observing band.
	Generally, this aliased signal does not cross-correlate and is present
	as a contribution to the noise level. However, in some circumstances,
	notably as the delay rate drops to zero (e.g., around source transit on
	north-south baselines), the aliased component can cross-correlate and
	be visible as &#8220;beating" on some baselines. This data must be flagged
	during the data processing.
      </p>

    <div class="section"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a name="observations-3mm"></a>1.6.3. 3mm Observations</h3></div></div></div>
      
      <p>
	The inner five <acronym class="acronym">ATCA</acronym> telescopes (i.e., excluding CA06) are outfitted
	with a 3mm receiver and can observe in the range 83 to 105 GHz.
	A noise diode has been added to the 3mm system on CA02 (only) to aid
	with 3mm polarisation calibration.  Aliasing effects similar to those
	described at 7mm can also arise in the 3mm band.
      </p>

      <p>
	A limited form of flexible scheduling is operational for observations
	<a class="indexterm" name="idm46395607192208"></a>
	at millimetre wavelengths. Consult the document 
	<a class="ulink" href="http://www.narrabri.atnf.csiro.au/observing/flexsched.html" target="_top"><em class="wordasword">Flexible Scheduling
	at ATCA</em></a> for details.
      </p>

      <p>
	A
	<a class="ulink" href="http://www.atnf.csiro.au/observers/docs/3mm/quickstart.html" target="_top">quickstart guide for 3mm observing</a>
	is also available.

    <div class="section"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a name="Procedure-for-mm-observations"></a>1.6.4. Procedure for mm observations</h3></div></div></div>
      
      
      <p>
	Observations in the mm band are run from a schedule file in the same way as
	cm-band observations. However, due to the effects of atmosphere stability, mm
	observations require bandpass and phase-calibration checks at a much more
	frequent rate.
      </p>

      <p>
	Note that as <acronym class="acronym">ATCA</acronym> does not Doppler track, it is important to have a
	<a class="indexterm" name="idm46395607184672"></a>
	good estimation of the magnitude of the Doppler shift for the line of
	interest. This is particularly so for the higher frequencies available to the
	3mm system. The sky frequency can be calculated using an
	<a class="ulink" href="http://www.narrabri.atnf.csiro.au/observing/obstools/velo.html" target="_top">online calculator</a>.
      </p>

      <p>
	A simple phase reference observation takes about an hour to run,
	including calibration. The following procedure is typical:
      </p>

      <p>
	Pointing calibration
	&#8594; Paddle calibration
	&#8594; Bandpass/Phase calibrator
	&#8594; Target source
	&#8594; Paddle calibration
	&#8594; Bandpass/Phase calibration
	&#8594; Target observation.
      </p>

      <p>
	The
	<a class="ulink" href="http://www.narrabri.atnf.csiro.au/observing/sched/cabb/" target="_top"><acronym class="acronym">CABB</acronym> web scheduler</a>
	can be used to construct the observing schedule.

        <p>
	  Elevation angles close to
	  the array horizon should be avoided because of the increased opacity
	  and poorer atmospheric stability. Therefore, observations of objects
	  with a declination further north of -50° are best
	  made using hybrid configurations (i.e., one using the N-S spur) in order
	  to achieve sufficient (u,v)-coverage.
	</p>

        <p>
	  Observations using very compact telescope configurations should be
	  made with caution, as telescope shadowing can be a significant
	  <a class="indexterm" name="idm46395607177120"></a>
	  problem, especially for sources at declinations which do not achieve
	  elevations high above the horizon. See
	  <a class="xref" href="aphs02.html" title="H.2. Shadowing Diagrams">Section H.2</a>
	  for details.
